# API Information

## Server

Grendel uses [Fuego](https://go-fuego.github.io/fuego/) to generate an OpenAPI schema based on the server code.
This schema is generated automatically every time the grendel binary is built.

### Dev

`api.swagger_ui` and `api.cors` can be enabled in the grendel config file to serve an API documentation UI at `server_address:port/swagger`

## Client

Grendel uses [ogen](https://ogen.dev/) to generate a golang client based off of the OpenAPI schema. Any time the OpenAPI schema changes, the ogen client will need to be regenerated by running `go generate github.com/ubccr/grendel/internal/api`

## Frontend

Grendel uses [React Query Codegen](https://openapi-react-query-codegen.vercel.app/) to generate a tanstack query client in TypeScript. Any time the OpenAPI schema changes, the frontend client will need to be regenerated by running `go generate github.com/ubccr/grendel/internal/api`
